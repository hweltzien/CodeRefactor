# Module-1-Challenge

## Description
After utilizing web-based resources and instructional support, this project helped me to apply classroom knowledge and practice technical skills. The end goal of this project is to grow a customer base for a mock company, Horiseon. Given starter code, modifications were made to improve web accessibility. When a codebase follows accessibility standards, the site is optimized for search engines. As a result, site traffic increases and costs for advertising decrease, maximizing profit.

I learned about the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements in HTML. I learned how to identify repeating elements and consolidate CSS selectors. I organized CSS selectors to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
